# find the next hint in the wrong part of the code 👀
# ---------------------------------------------------
# ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
# Hardcoding API keys directly in your source code is a huge security risk.
# If this code gets shared or pushed to a public repo, your key is exposed.
# ✅ Correct approach: Store secrets in environment variables (.env file) or use a secure vault.

import os
import openai

openai.api_key = "sk-tnlk1234567890test2/3h3e3r3e3i3t3i3s"

# ✅ RIGHT WAY:
# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv()
# openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Funny treasure discovery logic:
def discover_treasure():
    print("🔍 Searching for the treasure...")
    print("💡 Hint: The treasure is hidden where the mistake lives!")
    print("👉 Look at the hardcoded key above. That's the WRONG way!")
    print("✅ Next step: Move the key to a .env file and keep your secrets safe.")
    print("🎯 When you do, you'll unlock the next clue: 'Stage 3 awaits in the vault!'")

# Simulate calling OpenAI (mocked for fun)
def fake_openai_call():
    print("Pretending to call OpenAI with a fake key...")
    response = {
        "message": "Congratulations! You found the hint in the wrong place. Secrets belong in .env!"
    }
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    discover_treasure()
    print(fake_openai_call()["message"])
